The goal of this software is to provide an easy to use core that allows standard C developers who want to use the standard GNU AVR toolchain to be able to take advantage of the mass produced Arduino hardware. Arduino hardware was designed to use the arduino java based IDE. It uses its own language that seems to be somewhere between C and C++ but not quite either. For those of us who enjoy standard C and command line tools like gcc and make, this should allow avr development with your current workflow.

  * take advantage of the popular Arduino hardware
  * use GNU toolchain (avr-gcc, avr-libc, make) instead of the strange arduino processing language
  * prototype with Arduino hardware connected to breadboards, hookup wire, etc
  * order custom boards with the same connections as Arduino so that the same code can be used with production
